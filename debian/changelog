libcatmandu-html-perl (0.02-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  PROBLEM:
  t/muse.html is a copy of some MUSE website, with different copyright holders
  and: with no license. so this file is non-free, and we can't distribute it
  in debian.
  --> we need to repack the tarball, cf.
  https://perl-team.pages.debian.net/howto/repacking.html
  --> without the file the tests will fail, so we either need a substitute
  file or we need to disable them
  (or we can ask upstream to replace the file â€¦)

  TODO:
  - ITP bug

  * Initial release.
